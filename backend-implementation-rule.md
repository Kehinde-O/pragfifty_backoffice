# Backend Implementation Rules: Niger State IRS & LGA Revenue Payment System

This document outlines the core rules and guidelines for the backend implementation of the Niger State Internal Revenue Service & LGA Revenue Payment System.

## 1. General Technology & Architecture

1.1. **Programming Language & Framework:** The backend will be developed using **Java** with the **Spring Boot** framework.

1.2. **API Documentation:** **Swagger (OpenAPI)** must be implemented and kept up-to-date for all API endpoints. All endpoints should have clear descriptions, request/response examples, and error codes.

1.3. **Database:** A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) will be used. Specific schema details are outlined below.

1.4. **Security:**
    1.4.1. All sensitive data in transit must be encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.
    1.4.2. All sensitive data at rest (e.g., passwords, financial details) must be encrypted using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt for passwords).
    1.4.3. Implement comprehensive input validation for all incoming requests to prevent injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, etc.).
    1.4.4. Follow OWASP Top 10 security best practices.
    1.4.5. Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.

1.5. **Logging:**
    1.5.1. Comprehensive logging must be implemented for all critical operations, errors, and security events.
    1.5.2. Logs should include timestamps, user identifiers (where applicable), event details, and severity levels.
    1.5.3. Consider a centralized logging solution for easier monitoring and analysis.

1.6. **Modularity & Scalability:** Design the backend with modularity in mind, allowing for scalability and maintainability. Consider microservices or service-oriented architecture for distinct functional areas if complexity warrants.

1.7. **Configuration Management:** 
    1.7.1. Externalize configurations (database credentials, API keys, etc.) from the codebase. Use environment variables or dedicated configuration files.
    1.7.2. **Environment-Specific Configurations:** All environments (dev, staging, production) must have separate configurations to prevent accidental cross-environment operations.
    1.7.3. Create a centralized configuration service or repository that will serve as the source of truth for all configuration data across all backend services.
    1.7.4. **Niger State-Specific Configuration:**
        *   Set Niger State-specific tax rates and thresholds:
            *   Personal Income Tax progressive rates as per Nigeria's tax laws
            *   Development Levy: â‚¦100 flat rate per taxable person per annum
            *   Stamp Duty rates for Niger State
            *   Market Fee rates by category (Small, Medium, Large)
            *   Entertainment Tax: 5% of gate fees or entrance fees
        *   Configure Niger State's fiscal year period (January 1 - December 31)
        *   Set banking details for Niger State Internal Revenue Service
        *   Configure Niger State's 25 LGAs and their respective codes
        *   Set system-specific codes and prefixes for Niger State:
            *   TIN format/validation rules (adhering to FIRS standard)
            *   Receipt number prefix: "NSIRS-"
            *   Assessment reference prefix: "NSIRS-ASMT-"
            *   Payment reference prefix: "NSIRS-PMT-"
            *   Niger State IRS logo paths for document generation
            *   Niger State IRS official email domains and contact information

1.8. **Error Handling:** Implement consistent and informative error handling. API responses for errors should include clear error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes.

1.9. **Testing:**
    1.9.1. Unit tests must be written for all business logic components.
    1.9.2. Integration tests should cover interactions between different modules and external services.
    1.9.3. Aim for high test coverage.

1.10. **Audit and Monitoring:**
    1.10.1. Implement a comprehensive audit logging mechanism that records all significant actions, especially those related to financial transactions, assessments, and user access/permissions.
    1.10.2. Ensure all relevant actions are attributed to a specific user (either public portal user or backoffice user) where applicable.
    1.10.3. Log essential metadata: timestamp (with timezone - Nigeria/Lagos), user ID, IP address, action description, affected resources (IDs), result status.
    1.10.4. All Niger State IRS financial transactions must maintain audit trails for regulatory compliance and audit purposes.

## 1.11. API Response and Error Handling Standards

All backend APIs, especially those serving the public portal dashboard, must adhere to the following response and error handling standards to ensure consistency, predictability, and a good developer/user experience.

1.11.1. **Unified JSON Response Structure:**
    *   All API responses MUST be in JSON format.
    *   The top-level JSON object MUST contain the following fields:
        *   `success`: (Boolean) Indicates if the request was successful (`true`) or not (`false`).
        *   `message`: (String) A concise, human-readable message summarizing the outcome. For successes, this might be "Data retrieved successfully." For errors, it should be a merchant-relatable explanation.
        *   `data`: (Object|Array|null) The actual data payload.
            *   If the request retrieves a single resource, `data` will be a JSON object (e.g., `{ "id": 1, "name": "..." }`).
            *   If the request retrieves a list of resources (e.g., recent transactions, upcoming payments), `data` MUST be a JSON array (e.g., `[ { "id": 1, ... }, { "id": 2, ... } ]`). Even if the list is empty, it should be an empty array `[]`.
            *   If the request results in no data to return (e.g., a successful DELETE operation or no resource found for a non-erroring GET), `data` should be `null`.
        *   `error`: (Object|null) This field MUST be present and contain an error object if `success` is `false`. It MUST be `null` if `success` is `true`. The error object should contain:
            *   `code`: (String) A unique, machine-readable error code (e.g., "VALIDATION_ERROR", "UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS", "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND", "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR").
            *   `details`: (String|Object|Array) More specific, merchant-relatable information about the error. This can be a simple string, or for validation errors, it could be an object mapping field names to error messages or an array of error objects.

    *   **Success Response Example (Single Resource):**
        ```json
        {
          "success": true,
          "message": "User profile retrieved successfully.",
          "data": {
            "userId": "USR123",
            "name": "John Doe",
            "email": "john.doe@example.com"
          },
          "error": null
        }
        ```
    *   **Success Response Example (List of Resources - e.g., Upcoming Payments):**
        ```json
        {
          "success": true,
          "message": "Upcoming payments retrieved successfully.",
          "data": [
            { "assessmentId": "ASM001", "dueDate": "2023-12-01", "amount": 5000.00 },
            { "assessmentId": "ASM002", "dueDate": "2023-12-15", "amount": 1250.75 }
          ],
          "error": null
        }
        ```
    *   **Success Response Example (Empty List):**
        ```json
        {
          "success": true,
          "message": "No recent transactions found.",
          "data": [],
          "error": null
        }
        ```
    *   **Error Response Example (Validation Error):**
        ```json
        {
          "success": false,
          "message": "Validation failed. Please check the provided data.",
          "data": null,
          "error": {
            "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
            "details": {
              "email": "Invalid email format.",
              "password": "Password must be at least 8 characters long."
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    *   **Error Response Example (Resource Not Found):**
        ```json
        {
          "success": false,
          "message": "The requested assessment could not be found.",
          "data": null,
          "error": {
            "code": "ASSESSMENT_NOT_FOUND",
            "details": "No assessment exists with ID: ASM999"
          }
        }
        ```

1.11.2. **HTTP Status Codes:**
    *   Use appropriate HTTP status codes that align with the nature of the response.
        *   `200 OK`: General success for GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE (if no content, or if content is returned).
        *   `201 Created`: Successful creation of a resource (POST).
        *   `204 No Content`: Successful request but no data to return (e.g., successful DELETE). `data` should be `null`.
        *   `400 Bad Request`: Client-side error (e.g., malformed request, validation errors). `success` is `false`.
        *   `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. `success` is `false`.
        *   `403 Forbidden`: Authenticated user does not have permission to access the resource. `success` is `false`.
        *   `404 Not Found`: The requested resource does not exist. `success` is `false`.
        *   `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limiting. `success` is `false`.
        *   `500 Internal Server Error`: A generic error message for unexpected server-side errors. `success` is `false`. Avoid sending detailed stack traces to the client; log them server-side.

1.11.3. **Exception Handling:**
    *   The backend MUST gracefully handle all exceptions. Unhandled exceptions should not crash the application or expose sensitive information (like stack traces) in API responses.
    *   Global exception handlers should be implemented to catch any unhandled errors and format them according to the unified error response structure (1.11.1), typically returning a 500 status code with a generic error message and a unique error ID for tracking/logging.

1.11.4. **Merchant-Relatable Error Messages:**
    *   Error messages provided in the `message` and `error.details` fields should be clear, concise, and understandable to a non-technical user (merchant).
    *   Avoid exposing internal system details or jargon. For example, instead of "NullPointerException at com.example.service.PaymentService:123", use "An unexpected error occurred while processing your payment. Please try again or contact support if the issue persists. Error ID: XYZ123".
    *   For validation errors, clearly indicate which field(s) are problematic and why.

1.11.5. **Idempotency for Key Operations:**
    *   For operations that modify data (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), consider idempotency where appropriate, especially for payment-related actions, to prevent duplicate processing if a request is retried.

1.11.6. **Date and Time Format:**
    *   All dates and timestamps in API responses MUST be in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD` for dates, `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ` for timestamps) and should be in UTC.

## 2. User Management

2.1. **User Tables:**

## 3. Assessment, Billing, and Payment Processing

3.1. **Bill Creation:**
    3.1.1. **Automatic Bill Generation:** Any assessment raised or payment initiated (for services/revenue items that require pre-assessment) must automatically create a corresponding record in a `bills` table.
    3.1.2. `bills` table: Bill ID (PK), User ID (FK to `public_portal_users`), Revenue Head ID (FK to `revenue_heads`), Assessment ID (FK, if applicable), Bill Reference Number (Unique, format: NSIRS-{YEAR}-{SEQUENCE}), Amount Due, Amount Paid, Due Date, Bill Status (Pending, Partially Paid, Paid, Cancelled, Overdue), Generation Date, Description.
3.2. **Payment Recording:**
    3.2.1. **Payment Linking:** When a payment is successfully completed, the `bills` table record associated with that payment must be updated (e.g., `Amount Paid`, `Bill Status`).
    3.2.2. **Payment Record:** A new record must be created in a dedicated `payments` table for every successful payment transaction.
    3.2.3. `payments` table: Payment ID (PK), Bill ID (FK to `bills`), Payment Reference (from gateway, e.g., RRR), Gateway Transaction ID, Payment Date/Time, Amount Paid, Payment Method (Remita, Quickteller, Bank Branch), Payment Channel, Payment Status (Success, Failed, Pending), Currency.
    3.2.4. The `bills` table and `payments` table must be linked via a foreign key (e.g., `payments.BillID` references `bills.BillID`). For ad-hoc payments not tied to a pre-existing bill, a bill record should still be created and linked.
3.3. **Payment Notifications:**
    3.3.1. **Raw Payload Storage:** For each incoming payment notification (e.g., webhook from a payment gateway), the raw, unmodified payload must be stored.
        *   `payment_notifications_log` table: Log ID (PK), Payment Gateway (e.g., Remita, Quickteller), Received Timestamp, Raw Payload (TEXT/JSONB), Processing Status (Pending, Processed, Error), Error Details (if any), Source IP/Identifier.
    3.3.2. **Source Tracking:** The source of the notification (e.g., originating IP, gateway identifier) must also be stored alongside the payload.
3.4. **Payment Gateway Integration:**
    3.4.1. Secure integration with payment gateways (Remita, Quickteller).
    3.4.2. Backend generation of necessary references (e.g., RRR for Remita, unique transaction IDs).
    3.4.3. Secure handling of redirects and callbacks from gateways.
    3.4.4. Implement mechanisms to re-query payment status from gateways if initial confirmation is delayed.
3.5. **Bank Branch Payments:**
    3.5.1. Generation of a unique Payment Reference Number (PRN) for bank branch payments.
    3.5.2. API endpoint for bank tellers or a reconciliation process to post payments made via bank branches, referencing the PRN.
3.6. **Bulk Payments:**
    3.6.1. Backend processing and validation of uploaded bulk payment files (e.g., CSV/Excel for PAYE).
    3.6.2. Generation of a single payment reference for the total bulk amount or individual references as required by the payment gateway.
    3.6.3. Detailed feedback mechanism for validation errors in the uploaded file.

        *   Only the taxpayer who owns the assessment or authorized administrators should be able to view or manipulate an assessment.
        *   Implement role-based permissions for assessment operations.
        *   Track all assessment views and modifications in the audit log.

    16.3.2. **Validation:** 
        *   All assessment calculations must be re-verified on the backend, regardless of frontend calculations.
        *   Implement thorough validation of all input fields with appropriate error messages.
        *   Validate date ranges (e.g., assessment year cannot be in the future).

    16.3.3. **Storage:** 
        *   All assessment submissions, along with their calculation inputs and results, must be stored for audit purposes.
        *   Store calculation metadata to allow for recalculation if tax rules change.
        *   Maintain version history of assessments if they are modified after initial submission.

    16.3.4. **Assessment Generation:**
        *   Self-assessment submissions should be stored and, based on configuration, may either:
            *   Automatically generate a formal assessment and bill
            *   Be queued for review by a tax officer before formal assessment generation
        *   A configurable threshold amount could determine which path is taken
        *   Store the relationship between a self-assessment and its resulting formal assessment

    16.3.5. **Tax Calculation:** 
        *   The tax calculation algorithm should be maintained as a configurable service that can be updated to reflect current tax laws and rates.
        *   Tax calculation configurations should be versioned with effective dates.
        *   Calculation logs should store which version of the tax rules were applied.

    16.3.6. **Performance Considerations:**
        *   Implement caching for frequently accessed assessment lists and summary data.
        *   Use database indexing on commonly filtered and sorted fields.
        *   Consider pagination implementation for all list endpoints to handle large volumes of assessments.

    16.3.7. **PDF Generation:**
        *   All assessment PDFs should include:
            *   Official government/tax authority branding
            *   Assessment details (taxpayer info, assessment breakdown, calculation)
            *   Unique assessment reference number
            *   Payment instructions
            *   QR code for verification
            *   Digital signature or watermark to prevent forgery
        *   PDFs should be generated on-demand or cached based on volume considerations.
        *   Consider accessibility requirements in PDF generation.

    16.3.8. **Notifications:** 
        *   Users should be notified via email or in-app notification when:
            *   Their self-assessment is submitted
            *   Their self-assessment is approved or rejected
            *   An additional assessment is raised against them
            *   Assessment due dates are approaching
            *   Assessment status changes

This list is comprehensive but may evolve as the project progresses. All backend development should adhere to these rules and established best practices.

                },
                // ... other optional documents
              ]
            }
            ```

This list reflects the requirements derived from `TaxReturns.jsx` but may need further refinement based on complete business logic for tax filing and assessment. All development must adhere to these rules and established best practices.

## 20. Payment Processing Implementation

This section details the backend requirements for handling the complete payment lifecycle, integrating information from Section 3, the `public-portal-rule`, and components like `Payment.jsx`.

20.1. **Payment Initiation:**
    20.1.1. **API Endpoint:** `POST /api/payments/initiate`
    20.1.2. **Purpose:** To create a unique, trackable payment transaction record before interacting with any payment gateway or method.
    20.1.3. **Request Body Context:** Must accept sufficient context to identify what is being paid for. Examples:
        *   Assessment-based: `{ "assessmentId": "NSIRS-ASSMT-123" }`
        *   Liability-based: `{ "liabilityId": "NSIRS-LIB-456" }`
        *   Self-Assessment-based: `{ "selfAssessmentId": "NSIRS-SA-789" }` (Post-approval)
        *   Ad-hoc: `{ "revenueHeadId": 101, "lgaId": 5 (if required), "amount": 5000.00, "period": "2024", "dynamicFields": { "property_id": "XYZ" } }`
        *   Bulk Payment: `{ "bulkPaymentBatchId": "NSIRS-BULK-ABC" }`
    20.1.4. **Backend Action:**
        *   Validate the incoming context (e.g., does the assessment exist and belong to the user? Is the amount valid for the revenue head?).
        *   Create a record in the `payments` table (defined in 3.2.3) with a unique internal `transactionId` (or Payment ID), link it to the source (assessment, liability, bill, etc.), set initial status to 'Pending' or 'Initiated', and record the `amountDue`.
        *   If not derived from an assessment/bill, create a corresponding record in the `bills` table (3.1.2) and link it.
    20.1.5. **Response:** `{ "transactionId": "UNIQUE_TXN_ID", "amount": 5000.00, "currency": "NGN", "description": "Payment for Land Use Charge 2024" }`

20.2. **Fetching Available Payment Methods:**
    20.2.1. **API Endpoint:** `GET /api/payments/methods`
    20.2.2. **Purpose:** To provide the frontend (`Payment.jsx`) with the list of currently enabled payment channels configured in the backend.
    20.2.3. **Response:** Array of payment method objects, e.g.:
        ```json
        [
          { "id": "remita", "name": "Remita", "description": "Pay via Card, Bank, USSD, Wallet", "icon": "remita_logo", "fee": "Gateway fees apply", "isEnabled": true },
          { "id": "quickteller", "name": "Quickteller", "description": "Pay with Card or other Quickteller options", "icon": "quickteller_logo", "fee": "Gateway fees apply", "isEnabled": true },
          { "id": "bank_branch", "name": "Pay at Bank Branch", "description": "Generate a reference number to pay at any supported bank", "icon": "bank_icon", "fee": "No platform fee", "isEnabled": true },
          { "id": "ussd_direct", "name": "Direct USSD", "description": "Pay using a USSD code on your phone", "icon": "ussd_icon", "fee": "Network charges apply", "isEnabled": false } // Example: USSD might be routed via Remita instead
        ]
        ```
    20.2.4. **Backend Action:** Retrieve configuration settings defining enabled methods and their associated metadata.

20.3. **Payment Preparation & Gateway Interaction:**
    20.3.1. **API Endpoint:** `GET /api/payments/{transactionId}/prepare?method={methodId}` (or similar POST endpoint if preferred)
    20.3.2. **Purpose:** To generate gateway-specific references/URLs/codes after the user selects a payment method for the initiated `transactionId`.
    20.3.3. **Backend Action (Method-dependent):**
        *   **`methodId` = 'remita' / 'quickteller':**
            *   Call the respective gateway's API (securely, using configured credentials) with transaction details (amount, transactionId/orderId, customer email/phone, callback URL).
            *   Receive the gateway's payment reference (e.g., Remita RRR) and redirect URL.
            *   Update the `payments` record with the gateway reference.
            *   Return: `{ "gatewayReference": "RRR123456", "redirectUrl": "https://gateway.remita.net/...", "method": "remita" }`
        *   **`methodId` = 'bank_branch':**
            *   Generate a unique, persistent Payment Reference Number (PRN) specifically for this transaction. Store it in the `payments` record. The PRN should ideally incorporate check digits or patterns for easier teller input/validation.
            *   Return: `{ "paymentReferenceNumber": "NSIRS-PRN-987654321", "instructions": "Present this number at any partner bank branch...", "method": "bank_branch" }`
        *   **`methodId` = 'ussd_direct' (or via Remita/QT):**
            *   If direct: Generate the full USSD string (e.g., `*ServiceCode*MerchantCode*Amount*InternalRef#`). Requires configuration of codes.
            *   If via gateway: Call gateway API to get a USSD code/session specific to the transaction.
            *   Store the generated code/reference.
            *   Return: `{ "ussdCode": "*123*456*5000*NSIRS-XYZ#", "instructions": "Dial this code on your phone...", "method": "ussd" }`
    20.3.4. **Security:** All communication with gateways must be secure (HTTPS). Sensitive credentials must be stored encrypted and managed via configuration (1.7).

20.4. **Bank Payment Slip Generation:**
    20.4.1. **API Endpoint:** `GET /api/payments/{transactionId}/bank-slip`
    20.4.2. **Purpose:** To generate a downloadable/printable PDF payment slip for transactions intended for bank branch payment.
    20.4.3. **Prerequisite:** The transaction must have been prepared using the 'bank_branch' method (20.3.3) and have a generated PRN.
    20.4.4. **Backend Action:** Generate a PDF document containing: Beneficiary details (Niger State IGR), Taxpayer Name/ID, the generated PRN, Amount Due, Revenue Head/Description, Payment Instructions, Date Generated, potentially a Barcode/QR code representing the PRN.
    20.4.5. **Response:** PDF file stream (`Content-Type: application/pdf`).

20.5. **Payment Status Confirmation & Updates:**
    20.5.1. **Webhook Endpoints:**
        *   `POST /api/webhooks/remita`
        *   `POST /api/webhooks/quickteller`
        *   (Define endpoints for other relevant asynchronous updates if needed)
    20.5.2. **Purpose:** To receive real-time payment status updates pushed from payment gateways.
    20.5.3. **Backend Action:**
        *   **Security:** MUST rigorously validate the authenticity and integrity of incoming webhooks (e.g., verify request signature using shared secrets, check source IP if possible). Reject any invalid requests immediately.
        *   Log the raw, unmodified webhook payload in `payment_notifications_log` (3.3.1), including source IP/headers for traceability.
        *   Parse the validated payload to extract transaction status, gateway transaction ID, amount paid, payment date, etc.
        *   Find the corresponding internal transaction in the `payments` table (using the gateway reference or original transaction ID).
        *   Atomically update the `payments` record status ('Success', 'Failed'), `amountPaid`, `paymentDate`, `gatewayTransactionId`, etc.
        *   If status is 'Success', update the corresponding `bills` record status (3.2.1). Trigger downstream actions (e.g., notifications, receipt availability).
        *   Handle potential duplicate webhooks gracefully (idempotency).
        *   Log processing status (Processed, Error) in `payment_notifications_log`.
    20.5.4. **Manual/Reconciled Updates:** Implement mechanisms (e.g., backoffice interface, scheduled jobs) to update statuses for payments made via Bank Branch (based on reconciliation files) or USSD (if no webhook exists).
    20.5.5. **Status Polling API:**
        *   **Endpoint:** `GET /api/payments/{transactionId}/status`
        *   **Purpose:** Allow frontend to check the current status of a transaction, especially after redirection or if webhook delivery is uncertain.
        *   **Backend Action:** Retrieve the latest status from the `payments` table for the given `transactionId`.
        *   **Response:** `{ "transactionId": "UNIQUE_TXN_ID", "status": "Success", "amountPaid": 5000.00, "paymentDate": "...", "receiptAvailable": true }`
    20.5.6. **Gateway Re-query:** Implement background jobs or triggers to re-query payment status directly from the gateway API (as per 3.4.4) for transactions that remain 'Pending' for an extended period, using the stored gateway reference.

20.6. **E-Receipt Generation:**
    20.6.1. **API Endpoint:** `GET /api/receipts/{transactionId}` (or `GET /api/payments/{transactionId}/receipt`)
    20.6.2. **Purpose:** Provide downloadable official e-receipts for successfully completed transactions.
    20.6.3. **Backend Action:** Verify the transaction status is 'Success'. Generate a PDF receipt (as detailed in `public-portal-rule` VI.2) containing official branding, unique receipt number, QR code (optional), payment details, etc.
    20.6.4. **Response:** PDF file stream (`Content-Type: application/pdf`).

20.7. **Configuration:** Payment gateway credentials, enabled methods, fee structures (if managed internally), webhook secrets, and endpoint URLs must be externalized configuration (1.7).

This section consolidates payment processing rules. Development should adhere to these guidelines and relevant security best practices (1.4).

## 21. Quick Pay Feature Implementation

This section outlines the backend requirements to support the simplified "Quick Pay" feature, as observed in `QuickPay.jsx`, designed primarily for informal sector payments and common, high-frequency levies.

21.1. **Concept:** Quick Pay provides shortcuts for initiating payments for specific, predefined revenue items without navigating the full revenue head structure. These Quick Pay items are essentially configurations mapping to formal `revenue_heads` records.

21.2. **Configuration/Mapping:**
    21.2.1. The backend needs a mechanism to manage the mapping between Quick Pay options presented on the frontend and the corresponding formal `revenue_heads` record (`revenueHeadId`).
    21.2.2. This configuration should define for each Quick Pay option:
        *   Frontend display properties (title, description, icon - icon mapping handled by frontend).
        *   The corresponding `revenueHeadId`.
        *   Source (`State` or `LG`).
        *   Requirement for LGA selection (`requiresLga`).
        *   Any specific sub-context required (e.g., `requiresMarketSelection`).
        *   Fee rules (`feeMin`, `feeMax`, `isFeeFixed`, `defaultFeeAmount`).
    21.2.3. **(Recommended) API for Options:** `GET /api/quickpay/options`
        *   Purpose: To allow the frontend (`QuickPay.jsx`) to dynamically fetch the available Quick Pay configurations.
        *   Response: Array of Quick Pay option objects containing the mapping details defined in 21.2.2.
        *   Filtering/Search: The API endpoint **MUST** support a `search` query parameter (e.g., `?search=market`). The backend should filter the returned options, matching the `search` term (case-insensitive) against the option's `title`, `description`, `revenueHead`, and `subHead` (if applicable).

21.3. **Niger State-Specific Quick Pay Items:**
    21.3.1. **Common State Quick Pay Options:**
        *   Daily Market Fee (Niger State Markets)
        *   Hawkers Permit
        *   Niger State Development Levy
        *   Artisan Registration
        *   Mining Fee (Small Scale)
        *   Waste Disposal Fees
        *   Entertainment Tax (Small Events)
        *   Forestry Permit (Small Scale)
        *   Agricultural Produce Movement Permit
    
    21.3.2. **Common LGA Quick Pay Options:** (For Niger State's 25 LGAs)
        *   Daily Market Fee (LG)
        *   Kiosk Rate
        *   Cart/Wheelbarrow Fee
        *   Domestic Animal Fee
        *   Motor Park Fee
        *   Merriment/Road Closure Fee
        *   Wrong Parking Charges
        *   Slaughter Fee

21.4. **Payment Initiation:**
    21.4.1. The standard `POST /api/payments/initiate` endpoint (defined in 20.1) will be used.
    21.4.2. The frontend (`QuickPay.jsx`), after gathering user input for a selected Quick Pay option, will call this endpoint.
    21.4.3. **Expected Payload Structure:**
        ```json
        {
          "revenueHeadId": 123, // ID mapped from the selected Quick Pay option
          "lgaId": 45, // Included only if requiresLga is true and LGA selected
          "amount": 200.00, // Entered or default amount, validated against fee rules
          "payerPhoneNumber": "08012345678", // Collected phone number
          "context": { // Optional context field
            "sourceChannel": "QuickPay",
            "quickPayItemId": "market-fee", // Frontend ID of the selected option
            "marketName": "Ipaja Market" // Included only if requiresMarketSelection is true and market selected
          },
          "period": "YYYY-MM-DD" // Or relevant period like "2024" if applicable
        }
        ```
    21.4.4. **Backend Validation:** In addition to standard validation, the backend must verify:
        *   The provided `amount` adheres to the `min`/`max`/`fixed` rules associated with the mapped `revenueHeadId` (fetched from the Quick Pay configuration or `revenue_heads` table).
        *   An `lgaId` is provided if the mapped `revenueHeadId` requires it (based on configuration).
        *   The `payerPhoneNumber` format is valid.

21.5. **Data Storage:**
    21.5.1. The `payments` table should store the transaction initiated via Quick Pay like any other payment.
    21.5.2. Consider adding optional fields to the `payments` table or a related context table to store specific Quick Pay details for reporting/reconciliation if needed:
        *   `payer_phone_number` (VARCHAR)
        *   `source_channel` (VARCHAR, e.g., 'QuickPay', 'Standard', 'Bulk')
        *   `context_lga_id` (BIGINT, FK to LG table, if different from user's primary LGA)
        *   `context_market_name` (VARCHAR)
        *   `quick_pay_item_ref` (VARCHAR, storing the frontend ID like 'market-fee')

21.6. **Subsequent Payment Flow:**
    21.6.1. Once the payment is successfully initiated via `POST /api/payments/initiate` and a `transactionId` is returned, the subsequent steps (fetching methods, preparing the transaction for the selected gateway, handling webhooks/status updates, generating receipts) follow the standard process defined in Section 20.

This section outlines the specific backend considerations for the Quick Pay feature. Implementation should ensure seamless integration with the existing revenue head and payment processing systems.

## 22. Transaction History Implementation

This section details the backend requirements for fetching and displaying payment transaction history, as observed in `TransactionHistory.jsx`.

22.1. **Core Functionality:** Provide authenticated users access to a comprehensive, filterable, sortable, and paginated list of their past payment transactions.

22.2. **Primary API Endpoint:** `GET /api/payments/history`
    22.2.1. **Purpose:** To retrieve a list of payment transactions for the logged-in user, supporting various query parameters.
    22.2.2. **Query Parameters (Required for Functionality):**
        *   **Filtering:**
            *   `source`: String (e.g., 'Niger State IRS', 'LG', 'all')
            *   `lgaId`: Integer/String (ID or name of the Niger State LGA, relevant if `source` is 'LG' or 'all')
            *   `paymentMethod`: String (e.g., 'Remita', 'Quickteller', 'Bank', 'all')
            *   `status`: String (e.g., 'successful', 'pending', 'failed', 'all')
            *   `dateStart`: String (ISO 8601 Date, e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DD')
            *   `dateEnd`: String (ISO 8601 Date, e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DD')
            *   `search`: String (Free-text search query)
        *   **Sorting:**
            *   `sortBy`: String (e.g., 'date', 'amount', 'revenueHead', default: 'date')
            *   `sortDirection`: String ('asc', 'desc', default: 'desc')
        *   **Pagination:**
            *   `page`: Integer (Current page number, default: 1)
            *   `limit`: Integer (Items per page, default: 10)
    22.2.3. **Backend Action:**
        *   Authenticate the user.
        *   Query the `payments` table (and potentially related tables like `bills`, `revenue_heads`, `lgas` for names/descriptions if not denormalized) for records matching the user ID and all active filter parameters.
        *   Apply the search query across relevant fields (e.g., `payments.id`, `payments.gateway_reference`, `revenue_heads.name`, `bills.description`).
        *   Apply sorting based on `sortBy` and `sortDirection`.
        *   Apply pagination using `page` and `limit`.
        *   Calculate summary statistics (total successful amount, counts by status) based *only* on the filtered results *before* pagination is applied.
    22.2.4. **Response Structure:**
        ```json
        {
          "items": [
            {
              "id": "NSIRS-TXN-12345", // Internal Payment ID
              "transactionRef": "NSIRS-REF-2023-001", // Gateway or Bank Branch Ref
              "date": "2023-09-15T10:30:00Z", // ISO 8601 Timestamp
              "revenueHead": "Personal Income Tax", // Name of the revenue head
              "source": "Niger State IRS", // 'Niger State IRS' or 'LG'
              "lga": "N/A", // Niger State LGA Name or N/A
              "amount": 145000.00,
              "paymentMethod": "Remita",

              "description": "Annual Personal Income Tax Payment" // From Bill or derived
            },
            // ... other transaction items
          ],
          "pagination": {
            "totalItems": 125, // Total count matching filters

22.3. **Transaction Detail API Endpoint:** `GET /api/payments/{transactionId}`
    22.3.1. **Purpose:** To retrieve all available details for a single payment transaction, identified by its internal `transactionId`.
    22.3.2. **Backend Action:** Authenticate user and verify they own the transaction. Fetch the corresponding record from the `payments` table and any related details (e.g., linked bill info, revenue head details, payer context if stored).
    22.3.3. **Response:** A detailed transaction object, potentially including more fields than the list view (e.g., specific gateway IDs, full description, link to related assessment if applicable).

22.4. **Data Source & Performance:**
    22.4.1. Primarily queries the `payments` table.
    22.4.2. Database indexes are CRITICAL on `user_id`, `payment_date`, `status`, `source`, `lga_id` (if applicable), `payment_method`, and any fields used in the text search for efficient filtering and sorting.

22.5. **Authorization:** All endpoints MUST ensure users can only access their own transaction data.

22.6. **Receipt/Retry Links:** The data returned by both list and detail endpoints should implicitly contain the necessary identifiers (e.g., `transactionId`) for the frontend to construct links for downloading receipts (Section 20.6) or retrying payments (Section 20.3).

This section outlines the backend requirements for the transaction history feature. Focus on efficient querying and accurate data presentation is key.

## 23. Bulk PAYE Remittance Processing

This section details the backend requirements for the bulk upload and processing of Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) remittances, typically submitted monthly by employers to the Niger State Internal Revenue Service. This expands on the general bulk payment rules in Section 3.6.

23.1. **Template Definition & Access:**
    23.1.1. **Standard Template:** The backend system must define a standard Niger State PAYE remittance template format, preferably using Excel (`.xlsx`).
    23.1.2. **Required Columns (Example):** Employee TIN, Employee Full Name, Gross Income, Pension Contribution (Employee), NHF Contribution, NHIS Contribution, Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA), Taxable Income, Monthly Tax Due.
    23.1.3. **Template Download API:** `GET /api/templates/paye`
        *   Purpose: To provide users (employers) with the current, official Niger State PAYE remittance template file.
        *   Response: Excel file stream (`Content-Type: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet`).

23.2. **Upload API:**
    23.2.1. **Endpoint:** `POST /api/payments/bulk/upload?type=PAYE`
    23.2.2. **Request:** Multipart/form-data including:
        *   `file`: The filled PAYE template (`.xlsx`).
        *   `assessmentMonth`: String (e.g., "January", "February"), Required.
        *   `assessmentYear`: Integer (e.g., 2024), Required.
    23.2.3. **Authentication:** Requires authenticated user session (typically a business user profile).

23.3. **Backend Processing & Validation:**
    23.3.1. **Initial Steps:** Receive file and parameters. Assign a unique `batchId` for tracking.
    23.3.2. **Parsing:** Parse the uploaded Excel file according to the defined template structure.
    23.3.3. **Validation (Row-by-Row):** Perform rigorous validation for each employee record:
        *   Check for required fields (TIN, Name, Income, Tax Due, etc.).
        *   Validate data types and formats (e.g., TIN format, numeric values).
        *   **Calculation Verification:** Re-calculate Taxable Income and Monthly Tax Due based on Gross Income, Deductions, and applicable tax rules (e.g., rules from Section 16.2.2 adapted for monthly calculation, or current official PAYE tax tables). Flag discrepancies between submitted tax and calculated tax.
        *   Cross-check against available databases (e.g., TIN validation if feasible).
        *   Log all validation errors, referencing the specific row and column/field.
    23.3.4. **Batch Status:** Maintain the status of the batch (e.g., `Uploading`, `Validating`, `ValidationError`, `Validated`, `PendingPayment`, `Paid`).

23.4. **Validation Feedback:**
    23.4.1. **Error Scenario:** If validation fails:
        *   Update batch status to `ValidationError`.
        *   Store detailed error messages associated with the `batchId`.
        *   **Error Retrieval API:** `GET /api/payments/bulk/{batchId}/errors` -> Response: Array of error objects, e.g., `{ "row": 5, "column": "Tax Due", "message": "Calculated tax (N5,500) does not match submitted tax (N5,000)" }`.
        *   The initial upload API response could indicate immediate failure or provide the `batchId` for polling/checking status and errors.
    23.4.2. **Success Scenario:** If validation passes:
        *   Calculate the total `amountBilled` (sum of Monthly Tax Due for all valid rows).
        *   Store batch summary: `batchId`, `userId`, `assessmentMonth`, `assessmentYear`, `totalEmployees`, `totalAmountBilled`, `filePath`, `status` (`Validated`).

23.5. **Bill Generation & Payment Initiation:**
    23.5.1. **Automatic Bill Creation:** Upon successful validation (`Validated` status), automatically create a corresponding record in the `bills` table (3.1.2) for the `totalAmountBilled`.
        *   Link the bill to the `batchId`.
        *   Set `BillStatus` to 'Pending'.
        *   Generate a unique `billReferenceNumber` (format: NSIRS-PAYE-{YEAR}{MONTH}-{SEQUENCE}).
    23.5.2. **Upload API Response (Success):** Return details needed for next steps:
        ```json
        {
          "batchId": "NSIRS-BATCH-PAYE-XYZ",
          "status": "Validated",
          "totalEmployees": 55,
          "totalAmountBilled": 1234567.89,
          "billReferenceNumber": "NSIRS-PAYE-202403-ABC",
          "assessmentMonth": "March",
          "assessmentYear": 2024
        }
        ```
    23.5.3. **Pay Online:** The frontend uses the `billReferenceNumber` or `batchId` to initiate payment via the standard flow: `POST /api/payments/initiate` with context `{ "bulkPaymentBatchId": "NSIRS-BATCH-PAYE-XYZ" }` or `{ "billReferenceNumber": "NSIRS-PAYE-202403-ABC" }` (as defined in 20.1.3).
    23.5.4. **Print Bill API:** `GET /api/payments/bulk/{batchId}/bill` (or `/api/bills/{billReferenceNumber}/pdf`)
        *   Purpose: Generate a PDF document representing the consolidated bill for the PAYE batch.
        *   Content: Employer details, Assessment Period (Month/Year), Total Employees, Total Amount Due, Bill Reference Number, Payment Instructions.
        *   Response: PDF file stream.

23.6. **Transaction History for Bulk PAYE:**
    23.6.1. **API Endpoint:** `GET /api/payments/bulk/history?type=PAYE` (or integrate into general history endpoint `GET /api/payments/history` with filters).
    23.6.2. **Purpose:** To list past PAYE bulk upload batches for the employer.
    23.6.3. **Filtering/Sorting:** By Assessment Year, Month, Status.
    23.6.4. **Response Data per item:** `batchId`, `assessmentYear`, `assessmentMonth`, `companyName` (from user profile), `totalEmployees`, `amountBilled`, `billReferenceNumber`, `generatedDate`, `status` (`Validated`, `PendingPayment`, `Paid`, `ValidationError`), `receiptNumber` (if paid), `transactionReference` (from `payments` table if paid).

23.7. **Database Considerations:**
    23.7.1. Need tables for: `bulk_payment_batches`, `bulk_payment_batch_items` (optional, if storing individual employee lines from successful uploads), `bulk_payment_batch_errors`.
    23.7.2. Ensure relationships between batches, bills, and eventual payments are maintained.

This section provides detailed backend requirements for the PAYE bulk remittance feature, ensuring validation, bill generation, and integration with the standard payment flow.

## 24. Liabilities Module Integration

24.1. **Automatic Creation:**
    24.1.1. **Assessment System Integration:**
        *   Liabilities should be automatically created when assessments are issued
        *   When an assessment is paid, the corresponding liability should be updated or removed

    24.1.2. **Payment System Integration:**
        *   When a user selects "Pay Now" for a liability, the payment initiation process should be pre-populated with the liability details
        *   After successful payment, the liability should be marked as paid and removed from the active liabilities list

    24.1.3. **User Profile Integration:**
        *   Liabilities should be associated with the correct user profile (individual or business)
        *   For businesses, liabilities may be associated with specific business activities or locations

24.2. **Performance and Efficiency Considerations**
